**KEY INSIGHT**
*Transforming data using search,find and replace correcting all the ,Misspellings adding an age catergory using if statements,decreasing the decimal to make the numbers more readable 

PHASE 2: CREATING PIVOT TABLES 
     Having cleaned the data ,up to par,construction of pivot tables can comence,using the age catergory as well and the aggregates needed.

PHASE 3:FINAL PHASE
     
     To be able to create interactive dashboard you need to understand pivot tables ,be able to create scenarios that suit the business requirement questions therefore one can practice slicer using the charts created from pivot tables
